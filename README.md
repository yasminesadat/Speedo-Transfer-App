# Speedo Transfer App

**Speedo Transfer App** is a Kotlin-based mobile application that allows users to transfer and manage amounts between bank accounts with ease. Developed with modern Android practices, the app utilizes Jetpack Compose for the UI, follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, and integrates Retrofit for network operations. Coroutines are used for asynchronous operations, and Shared Preferences are employed for local data storage. Additionally, the app sends a notification to the user upon a successful transfer.
